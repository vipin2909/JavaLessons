DigitalOcean definition -> Decorator is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime.
At the same time other instances of the same class will not be affected by
this, so individual objects get the modified behaviour.

Adding behavior with altering the class itself.

Motivation :-
1) Want to augment an object with additional functionality
2) Do not want to require or alter existing code(OCP)
3) Want to keep new functionality separate (SRP)
4) Need to be able to interact with existing structures
5) Two options
   5 i) Inherit from required object if possible, some classes are final
   5 ii) Build a Decorator, which simply references the decorated Object(s)

Facilitates the addition of behaviors of individual objects without
inheriting from them.
